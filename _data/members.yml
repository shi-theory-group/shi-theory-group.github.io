  description: "Liang received his B.S. degree in Chemistry in 2009 from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and did undergraduate research with Prof. Yao Fu. He then moved to Madison WI, and received his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 2014 under the supervison of Prof. James Skinner. After doing a postdoc with Prof. Adam Willard at MIT, he started his independent career at UC Merced in 2016. He is interested in developing and applying models to understand structure, dynamics, and spectroscopy of heterogeneous molecular systems."
