#  description: "Shao-Yu is a joint postdoc between the [Isborn](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/cisborn) and Shi groups, and he is working on the modeling of optical spectroscopy. His previous research project focused on searching the new materials in combination with scientific programming and new numerical algorithm development. For instance, 1) successfully developed a cost effective genetic algorithm code for predicting high-efficiency organic light emitter device (OLED) material 2) to generate the high-accuracy thermodynamic properties, such as, entropy, enthalpy, free energy and multi-dimensional anharmonic frequency calculations (full vibrational configuration interaction (Full-VCI) and vibrational perturbation theory (VPT) ). 3) heterogeneous catalytic reactions for organic molecules adsorbed on metal surface and generated their time-resolved/ temperature-dependent vibrational spectra by using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and their time-frequency analysis.
