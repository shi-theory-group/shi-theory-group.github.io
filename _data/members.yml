  description: "Lin was a graduate student at University of Pittsburgh with Angela Gronenborn and Ivet Bahar. Next, Lin was a joint post-doc and Li Foundation fellow between the Kortemme and Fraser labs, using computational and experimental techniques to study the evolution of protein dynamics. Since 2015, she has continued her research in the Fraser lab and has become the key go-to person for its day-to-day operations!"

  description: 'Michael was an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, where he was introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography as a research assistant in Tom Alber’s laboratory. He received his Ph.D. in 2014 from UCLA, where he worked under the direction of Todd Yeates, investigating structure-function relationships in a key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” As a postdoc in the Fraser Lab, Michael will examine how amino acid substitutions alter the catalytic rates of enzymes by modifying their conformational ensembles. This work will emphasize the characterization of disease-associated mutations found in human proteases. Additionally, Michael will work on developing experimental methodology for studying conformational heterogeneity and structural dynamics of protein molecules using X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs).


  Mike has been supported by a BioXFEL postdoctoral fellowship and is currently supported by a F32 fellowship from NHLBI'
