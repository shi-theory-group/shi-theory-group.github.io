  description: "Liang received his B.S. degree in Chemistry in 2009 from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and did undergraduate research with Prof. Yao Fu. He then moved to Madison WI, and received his Ph.D. in Chemistry in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. James Skinner. After doing a postdoc with Prof. Adam Willard at MIT, he started his independent career at UC Merced in 2016. He is interested in developing and applying models to understand structure, dynamics, and spectroscopy of heterogeneous molecular systems."

  description: "Bowen received his B.S. in Chemistry from Peking University in 2015 and did undergraduate research with Prof. Jin Zhang and Prof. Lianming Tong. He completed his M.S. degree in Chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Josef Michl in the University of Colorado Boulder in 2018. He then joined Liangâ€™s group as graduate student. His current research interest is improving modeling of charge transfer within complex environments, e.g., water and its solutions. He is also interested in applying molecular dynamics (MD) to study the behavior of antifreeze proteins in interfacial environments."
