# Welcome to the Shi Group!

We are part of the [Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://chemistry.ucmerced.edu/), and the [Center for Chemical Computation and Theory (ccCAT)](https://cccat.ucmerced.edu/) at the [University of California, Merced (UCM)](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) . 

We are a theoretical chemistry research group with interests in developing and applying multi-scale modeling methods to understand the structure, dynamics and spectroscopy of complex condensed-phase molecular systems. 

We are located on the second floor of the Arts and Computational Sciences (ACS) building at UCM.
