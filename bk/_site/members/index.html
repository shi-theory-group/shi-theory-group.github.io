        <p class="text-justify"><p>James was an undergraduate at McGill University, where he worked in the lab of <a href="http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/fagotto/">Francois Fagotto</a> on <a href="/publications#20974811">Xenopus developmental biology</a>. During the summers, he returned to his hometown of Toronto and worked in <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/davidsonlab/Davidson_Lab/Home.html">Alan Davidson’s lab</a> on TetR repressor biophysics and <a href="/publications#16631788">bacteriophage genomics</a>.</p>

<p>He moved to California in 2005 to do his PhD in <a href="http://mcb.berkeley.edu">Molecular and Cellular Biology at UC Berkeley</a>. There, he worked with <a href="http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/">Tom Alber</a> creating  biophysical methods to characterize <a href="/publications#20499387">protein side chain flexibility</a> in <a href="/publications#17573816">high resolution</a> X-ray <a href="/publications#24363322">electron density maps</a>. They applied these techniques to study connections between <a href="/publications#19956261">conformational dynamics and enzymatic catalysis</a>, showing that <a href="/publications#21918110">room temperature</a>, but not standard cryogenic, X-ray data collection could reveal the structural basis for critical functional motions.</p>

<p>Near the end of his PhD, he was an <a href="http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/short-term-fellowships">EMBO Short-Term Fellow</a> in <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biological_Chemistry/scientist/Tawfik/">Dan Tawfik’s lab</a>. Concurrently, he authored the problems and solutions manual for the physical chemistry textbook <a href="http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815341888">The Molecules of Life</a> by Kuriyan, Konforti, and Wemmer.</p>

<p>In January 2011, James started his <a href="http://fellows.ucsf.edu/">independent career</a> as a <a href="http://qb3.ucsf.edu/events/mini-bio-james-fraser.shtml">QB3 at UCSF Fellow</a> affiliated with the <a href="http://cmp.ucsf.edu/">Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology</a>. In January 2013, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://bts.ucsf.edu">Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences</a> and the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (<a href="http://qb3.org">QB3</a>) with promotion to Associate Professor in 2016. The lab is also part of the <a href="http://msg.ucsf.edu">Macromolecular Structure Group at UCSF</a> and <a href="https://www.bioxfel.org/">BioXFEL</a>, a Science and Technology Center established by the National Science Foundation. We maintain a deep connection with <a href="http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~mcfuser/">Beamline 8.3.1.</a>, directed by <a href="http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~jamesh/">James Holton</a>, at the <a href="http://www-als.lbl.gov/">Advanced Light Source</a>. James is also a Consulting Professor in Photon Science at the Stanford SLAC National Laboratory.</p>

This work will emphasize the characterization of disease-associated mutations found in human proteases. Additionally, Michael will work on developing experimental methodology for studying conformational heterogeneity and structural dynamics of protein molecules using X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs).</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><p>Alex earned a B.S. in Kinesiology &amp; Health Promotion, and a M.S. in Molecular Biology, from the University of Wyoming. During his time there, he became fascinated with the role that protein structural dynamics play in molecular mechanisms. Thus, Alex’s work in the Fraser Lab seeks to understand how proteins move, and to what degree these movements are altered in the context of human disease. He has been fortunate to receive a <a href="https://graduate.ucsf.edu/edlund-scholarship">Matilda Edlund Scholarship</a>, a <a href="http://support.ucsf.edu/discoveryfellows">UCSF Discovery Fellowship</a>, and an <a href="https://www.arcsfoundation.org/">ARCS Foundation Scholar Award</a> to support this work. Outside of the lab, Alex tries to interlace art, science, and outdoor adventures while honing his communication skills.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><p>Kazu was a graduate student at Tokyo Institute of Technology, where he studied bacterial metabolism under the guidance of Professor Masaaki Wachi. On completion of his studies, he received his Ph.D. in 2014. Then, he started to work for Asahi Kasei, a pharmaceutical company, where he was introduced to structural biology, especially X-ray crystallography. To study the basics of crystallography, Kazu was sent on loan to the Structural Biology Research Center, which is directed by Professor Toshiya Senda, in KEK for one year. Since August 2017, he has been a visiting researcher in the Fraser Lab. Kazu is interested in conformational heterogeneity and structural dynamics of protein molecules.</p>

        <p class="text-justify"><p>Saulo earned his PhD in 2016 from the University of Oxford, where he worked with Prof. Charlotte Deane developing methods for protein structure prediction. After finishing his doctorate, he worked as a postdoc at Oxford for 2 years, focusing on protein contact prediction and coevolution. He joined the lab in 2018 as a joint postdoctoral scholar with Dr. Henry van den Bedem. His current research focuses on using computational methods to understand protein structures and dynamics and how these relate to experimentally derived electron densities.</p>
