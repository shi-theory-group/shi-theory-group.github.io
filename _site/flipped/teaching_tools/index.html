<p>#Teaching Tools- Guidelines for Formatting and Content#</p>

<p>Thank you very much for preparing Teaching Tools for an iBiology talk.  We are happy to include your name on the Teaching Tools page to indicate your participation in preparing these resources.</p>

<p>The goal of providing Teaching Tools to accompany iBioSeminar videos is to give teachers a choice of resources so that they can select those that are appropriate for their students and teaching style.  When writing questions, please keep in mind the diversity of classroom settings- undergraduates in small colleges in the USA, India, or Africa as well as more advanced beginning graduate students in various countries.</p>

<p>Please use the same headings for your Teaching Tools for uniformity but feel free to vary the style of notes or questions.  See the accompanying Teaching Tools for examples.</p>

<p>##For Part 1: The Introductory Lecture##</p>

<p><strong>Key words and terms</strong></p>

<p>Provide 6-15 key words or terms for this lecture.  These can be used as a study guide and also for key word searches for the series.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture notes</strong></p>

<p>This section is a summary of the points of the lecture.  You can view the lecture and jot down notes and later convert the notes into sentences.  You may want to add a few more sentences if you feel more explanation is needed at any point.  Adding headings and subheadings to make the organization clearer is an option.</p>

<p><strong>Basic recommended reading for the classroom</strong></p>

<p>Basic reading that would be suitable for an undergraduate level.  For example, a chapter from the Alberts’ Molecular Biology of the Cell or another textbook and also a basic review (can be from the speaker’s lab or elsewhere).</p>

<p><strong>Review Questions</strong></p>

<p>These are a set of “basic” short answer or multiple-choice questions.  These are questions that a teacher might wish to use to see if students remember the basic points/concepts described in the lecture.  Ideally, it would be great to extract ~10 questions from the lecture</p>

<p>We ask that you provide brief answers to these questions.  The answers can be accessed by teachers who register on iBiology.org.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion Questions</strong></p>

<p>We envision teachers using iBioSeminars to “flip” the classroom, ie assigning the videos as homework followed by discussions in the classroom.  Thus, the discussion questions should be thought-provoking questions that could be used by a teacher or graduate student, acting as a facilitator, to lead student discussion and assess students understanding of the material in the video. The questions should be based upon subject matter found in the lecture, however, all questions need not have “defined” answers (i.e. can have some degree of ambiguity as is true in the real world).</p>

<p>Please provide reasonably complete answers to these questions. Again, answers will be accessed by teachers who register on iBiology.org.</p>

<p><strong>Explain/teach these concepts to a friend</strong></p>

<p>Students learn from teaching each other.  This section provides some key concepts or techniques students can teach to one another.  This will allow students to apply their knowledge and understanding of the lecture to a new area. In some cases, this may require some background reading to fill in details that are very briefly described in the lecture.</p>

<p><strong>Research the literature on your own</strong></p>

<p>Here, you can provide a set of topics that are not covered within the lecture but which are closely related subjects that students could research on their own helping to build their ability to analyze and evaluate scientific literature.</p>

<p>##For Part 2 or 3: Research Lecture (Please note, if you have more than one research lecture, it is only necessary to do this for one)##</p>

<p>NO lecture notes, but all other topics as described above:</p>

<p><strong>Key words and terms</strong></p>

<p><strong>Review Questions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Discussion Questions</strong></p>

<p><strong>Explain/teach these concepts to a friend</strong></p>

<p><strong>Research the literature on your own</strong></p>

<p><strong>Papers for Journal Club</strong></p>

<p>Pick a few papers (e.g. from your lab or others) that are related to the subject described in the talk.  Provide a very short perspective on what these papers are about and why they were chosen.</p>
